# Spotify_Frontend

This is a simple Spotify frontend. 

In this small project, I had my first contact with tailwind where I used tailwind as CSS...

Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides a catalog of custom style classes to quickly style our htm avoiding the user to write long codes.

Take a look and check out the small demonstration of the projects I've worked on. [ Clique here to see ](https://)
